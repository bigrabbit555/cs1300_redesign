        <h1>cs1300 Responsive Redesign</h1>
        <h2>Chosen website: <a href="https://www.gcbpvd.org/" target="_blank"><u>Grad Center Bar</u></a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="image">

    <div class="text">
        <p>I chose this website to redesign because it has relevant information to the Brown community, but the current design makes it difficult for users 
            to find the information they're looking for at a glance.</p>
        <h3>Usability Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Text is difficult to read because it is over an image</li>
            <li>Information is not clearly labeled/categorized
                <ul>
                    <li>Users need to skim the entire page to find what they are looking for</li>
                    <li>Users may struggle to find the same information again on a return visit</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The main title and navigation menu are too small and easy to miss relative to the main content of the page</li>
            <li>Some of the most important information, such as the hours of the bar, is tucked away at the very bottom of the site</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Accessibility Problems</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank"><u>WAVE</u></a> program highlights several instances of low contrast, the greatest obvious 
            offender of which is the white "GCB" that overlays the background image directly with no highlighting.  It also draws attention to several 
            invisible (black-on-black) and non-functional links, one of which is near the top of the page and opens a seemingly defunct checkout cart and 
            the other of which invites the reader to "Learn more" at the bottom fo the page but has no actual functionality.  These dud elements, appearing 
            almost to be left over from previous iterations of the site, would surely confuse any screen reader.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In the actual construction of my responsively redesigned site, I found that I didn't even have to make use of many of the fancier CSS techniques I had 
            anticipated needing.  I think my decision to keep the flow of information relatively linear definitely made things easier in this regard.</p>
        <p>With no errors, contrast errors, or alerts in WAVE, and appropriate scaling for pages of different sizes, I believe that my responsive redesign is 
            largely successful in improving both the usability and accessibility of the original site.</p>
